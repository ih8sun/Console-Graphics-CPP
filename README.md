# About Console-Graphics-CPP

Here I will be uploading recovered projects using c++/cli, basically, most of these projects tend to be graphics or minigames such as ship games, character movement, etc.

# How can I install it ?

If you want to install it, just install Visual Studio 22, get in the project you want to test and
open de .sln file.
